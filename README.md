## Eatable
#### A React based, allergen friendly, restaurant searching app

### About

Navigating through restaurant/food options can be time consuming, especially for someone with severe food allergies, like myself. When traveling, I tend to spend hours sifting through restaurant menus, searching for potentially safe places to eat.  The time has come to automate some of that work!  Eatable is a tool I am building for myself, which will allow for nut and/or shellfish free restaurant searching within a specific city or zip code.
